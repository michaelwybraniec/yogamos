Yoga is an ancient practice that has evolved over thousands of years. It combines physical postures, breathing techniques, and meditation to promote physical and mental well-being. This documentation provides an overview of yoga's origins, historical evolution, and its significance across different cultures.

## Origins of Yoga

Yoga is believed to have originated over **5,000 years ago** in the Indus Valley Civilization. The earliest references to yoga can be found in:

- **Vedas (c. 1500 BCE - 500 BCE)** â€“ The oldest sacred texts of Hinduism, which mention meditation and spiritual practices.
- **Upanishads (c. 800 BCE - 200 BCE)** â€“ Philosophical scriptures that introduce early concepts of self-awareness and liberation (moksha).
- **Bhagavad Gita (c. 200 BCE - 200 CE)** â€“ A key Hindu scripture that describes different forms of yoga, including Karma Yoga (yoga of action), Bhakti Yoga (yoga of devotion), and Jnana Yoga (yoga of knowledge).

## Classical Yoga: The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali

One of the most influential texts in yoga philosophy is the **Yoga Sutras of Patanjali**, written around **200 CE**. This text outlines the **Eight Limbs of Yoga**, which form the foundation of modern yoga:

1. **Yama** â€“ Ethical disciplines (e.g., non-violence, truthfulness)
2. **Niyama** â€“ Personal observances (e.g., purity, contentment)
3. **Asana** â€“ Physical postures (modern yoga's most recognized aspect)
4. **Pranayama** â€“ Breath control
5. **Pratyahara** â€“ Withdrawal of senses
6. **Dharana** â€“ Concentration
7. **Dhyana** â€“ Meditation
8. **Samadhi** â€“ Enlightenment or ultimate bliss

## Medieval and Modern Developments

During the medieval period, yoga evolved further:

- **Hatha Yoga (11th-15th century CE)** â€“ Introduced by yogis like **Gorakhnath**, focusing on physical postures (asanas), breathing exercises (pranayama), and energy control.
- **Bhakti and Tantra Yoga (15th-18th century CE)** â€“ Emphasized devotion, rituals, and inner transformation.

In the **19th and 20th centuries**, yoga spread globally, influenced by figures such as:

- **Swami Vivekananda (1863-1902)** â€“ Introduced yoga to the West during the 1893 Parliament of World Religions in Chicago.
- **Tirumalai Krishnamacharya (1888-1989)** â€“ The "father of modern yoga," who developed styles like Vinyasa and influenced teachers such as **B.K.S. Iyengar**, **Pattabhi Jois**, and **Indra Devi**.

## Yoga Today

Yoga has transformed into a global phenomenon, with various styles including:

- **Hatha Yoga** â€“ Traditional and gentle
- **Vinyasa Yoga** â€“ Dynamic and flow-based
- **Ashtanga Yoga** â€“ Physically intense, structured sequences
- **Bikram/Hot Yoga** â€“ Practiced in a heated room
- **Yin Yoga** â€“ Slow-paced and meditative
- **Kundalini Yoga** â€“ Focuses on breathwork and energy flow

Today, yoga is practiced for **physical health, mental clarity, and spiritual growth**, with millions of practitioners worldwide.
