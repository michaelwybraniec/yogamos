## Deployment Process

    Dev[Development Branch] -->|Pull Request| Main[Main Branch];
    Main -->|GitHub Actions: Build & Test| Deploy[GitHub Pages Deployment];
    Deploy -->|Live on GitHub Pages| Production[www.yogamos.es];
```

### GitHub Actions CI/CD Workflow

Our deployment process uses **GitHub Actions** to automate builds and deployments to GitHub Pages.

#### Workflow Breakdown:

1. **Trigger:** The workflow runs on every push to the `main` branch.
2. **Setup:** Installs Node.js, sets environment variables, and installs dependencies.
3. **Build & Generate:** Runs `yarn generate` to generate static files.
4. **Deploy:** Pushes the generated files to the `gh-pages` branch.

#### Workflow YAML (Simplified Version):

```yaml
name: Build and Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
          cache: 'yarn'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: yarn install --immutable

      - name: Generate static site
        run: yarn generate

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@v4
        with:
          branch: gh-pages
          folder: .output/public
```

## Architecture Overview

```mermaid
graph TD;
    User[User] -->|Browses| Browser[Browser]
    Browser -->|Requests| GitHubPages[GitHub Pages Hosting]
    GitHubPages -->|Serves| NuxtApp[Nuxt Static Files]
    NuxtApp -->|Fetches Data| API[API / CMS / Backend]
```

- **User**: The end-user accessing the website.
- **Browser**: Loads the static content from GitHub Pages.
- **GitHub Pages**: Hosts and serves the pre-built static Nuxt application.
- **Nuxt Static Files**: The output generated by Nuxt’s static site generation (`yarn generate`).
- **API / CMS / Backend**: External services for dynamic data fetching.

## Translation & SEO Configuration

YOGAMOS uses **@nuxtjs/i18n** to provide a seamless multilingual experience. Content is organized into language-specific folders (`content/en/`, `content/es/`, `content/fr/`), allowing users to access pages in their preferred language.

### SEO & Sitemap Configuration

We enhance discoverability with:

- `@nuxtjs/robots`: Ensures proper indexing and search engine rules.
- `@nuxtjs/sitemap`: Generates a dynamic sitemap for improved SEO.
- `@nuxtjs/seo`: Provides meta tags and OpenGraph integration.

## Testing

### Running Tests

Make sure you have installed Vitest:

```bash
yarn install -D vitest @vue/test-utils jsdom
```

Run tests using:

```bash
yarn test        # Run all tests
yarn test:watch  # Run tests in watch mode
yarn test:ui     # Open Vitest UI
```

### Testing Overview

- **Unit Tests**: Ensures components function correctly.
- **Integration Tests**: Validates interactions between components.
- **SEO Tests**: Checks meta tags.
- **Error Handling**: Ensures proper error responses.
